# Series Tracker
The Series Tracker is a personal database to keep track of "TV" series. It adds several episode details all taken from the series's Wikipedia page just by entering its URL.

Motivated to automate a process previously all done manually on spreadsheets, like Excel and Google Sheets, this has quicken the most tedious part of wanting to know what has been watched and when, as well as just a collection to show off.
